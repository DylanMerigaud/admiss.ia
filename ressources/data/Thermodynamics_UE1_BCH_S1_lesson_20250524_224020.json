It is primarily concerned with how these quantities relate to each other and how they change under various conditions.\n\n**Key Notions:**\n• **First Law of Thermodynamics:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.\n• **Second Law of Thermodynamics:** The total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time, and is constant if and only if all processes are reversible.\n• **Gibbs Free Energy:** A thermodynamic potential that measures the process-initiating work obtainable from a thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and pressure.\n\n**Clinical Relevance:** Understanding thermodynamics is crucial in medical biochemistry for processes such as enzyme kinetics, metabolic pathways, and drug interactions.\n\n**Related Concepts:** The Atom, Covalent Bonds and Non-Covalent Bonds, Molecular Orbitals",
