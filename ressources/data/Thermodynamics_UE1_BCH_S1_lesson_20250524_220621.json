    "lesson_content": "Detailed educational content covering Thermodynamics. Thermodynamics is the branch of chemistry that deals with the relationships between heat, work, temperature, and energy. In the context of General Chemistry, understanding thermodynamics is crucial for grasping how chemical reactions occur and how energy is transferred and transformed. This lesson will cover fundamental concepts such as the laws of thermodynamics, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. We will also explore the clinical relevance of thermodynamics, including its role in metabolic processes and drug interactions. Practical applications will be discussed, such as how thermodynamics principles are applied in medical diagnostics and treatments. Connections to related topics such as The Atom, Covalent Bonds and Non-Covalent Bonds, Molecular Orbitals, and Chemical Equilibrium will be made to provide a comprehensive understanding. Address weak areas: ['general concepts'] by providing clear definitions, examples, and step-by-step explanations.",

      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Gibbs free energy (ΔG) is a crucial concept in thermodynamics that helps determine the spontaneity of a chemical reaction. A reaction is spontaneous if ΔG is negative, indicating that the reaction will proceed without external energy input. This is particularly relevant in biochemical processes where energy efficiency is critical."

        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. This means that natural processes tend to move towards a state of greater disorder or randomness. Understanding entropy is essential for analyzing the feasibility of chemical reactions and biological processes."
