    "lesson_content": "**Amino Acids**\n\n**Definition:** Amino acids are organic compounds that combine to form proteins. They consist of an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a distinctive side chain (R group), all attached to a central carbon atom.\n\n**Key Notions:**\n• **Structure:** Alpha-carbon with four substituents: amino group, carboxyl group, hydrogen, and R group.\n• **Classification:** Essential vs. non-essential amino acids based on the body's ability to synthesize them.\n• **Function:** Building blocks of proteins, involved in various biochemical processes including metabolism, enzyme function, and neurotransmission.\n\n**Clinical Relevance:** Essential for protein synthesis, enzyme function, and neurotransmission. Deficiencies can lead to various disorders such as kwashiorkor and marasmus.\n\n**Related Concepts:** Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins, Enzymes",
