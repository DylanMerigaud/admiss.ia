They are formed by the combination of atomic orbitals from different atoms in a molecule.\n\n**Key Notions:**\n• **Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO):** The process by which atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals.\n• **Bonding and Antibonding Orbitals:** Bonding orbitals stabilize the molecule, while antibonding orbitals destabilize it.\n• **Molecular Orbital Energy Levels:** The energy levels of molecular orbitals determine the stability and reactivity of the molecule.\n\n**Clinical Relevance:**\nUnderstanding molecular orbitals is crucial for comprehending the behavior of drugs and biomolecules, such as enzyme-substrate interactions and drug-receptor binding.\n\n**Related Concepts:**\nThe Atom, Covalent Bonds and Non-Covalent Bonds, Molecular Orbitals",
