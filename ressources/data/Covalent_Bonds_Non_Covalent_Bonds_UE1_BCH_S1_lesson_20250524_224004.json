Non-covalent bonds include interactions such as hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and van der Waals forces, which are weaker but crucial for molecular stability and interactions.\n\n**Key Notions:**\n• **Covalent Bonds:** Formed by sharing electrons, leading to strong, directional bonds.\n• **Non-Covalent Bonds:** Include hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and van der Waals forces, which are weaker and non-directional.\n• **Clinical Relevance:** Essential for understanding molecular interactions in biological systems, drug design, and protein folding.\n\n**Clinical Relevance:**\nUnderstanding these bonds is crucial for drug design, protein folding, and molecular interactions in biological systems.\n\n**Related Concepts:**\nThe Atom, Covalent Bonds and Non-Covalent Bonds, Molecular Orbitals",
