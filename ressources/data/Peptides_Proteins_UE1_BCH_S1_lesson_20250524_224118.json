    "lesson_content": "**Peptides and Proteins**\n\n**Definition:** Peptides and proteins are biomolecules composed of amino acid chains. Peptides are short chains, while proteins are longer and more complex, often exhibiting specific three-dimensional structures.\n\n**Key Notions:**\n• **Primary Structure:** Sequence of amino acids in a peptide or protein.\n• **Secondary Structure:** Local spatial arrangement of the polypeptide backbone, such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets.\n• **Tertiary Structure:** Overall three-dimensional shape of a protein, determined by interactions between amino acid side chains.\n\n**Clinical Relevance:** Proteins are crucial for various biological functions, including enzymatic activity, structural support, and signaling. Dysfunction or misfolding of proteins can lead to diseases like Alzheimer's and cystic fibrosis.\n\n**Related Concepts:** Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins, Enzymes",
