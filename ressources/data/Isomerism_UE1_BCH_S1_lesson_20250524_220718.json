    "lesson_content": "Detailed educational content covering Isomerism. Isomerism is a fundamental concept in organic chemistry where molecules have the same molecular formula but different structures and properties. This lesson will cover the types of isomerism, including structural (constitutional) isomerism and stereoisomerism (geometric and optical isomerism). We will explore how isomerism affects the properties and reactivity of organic compounds, with a focus on alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, amines, aldehydes, ketones, and acids. The lesson will also include practical examples and clinical relevance, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the general concepts related to isomerism. We will connect these concepts to the representation of organic molecules and their applications in biochemistry.",
