    "lesson_content": "Detailed educational content covering Amino Acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and play crucial roles in various biological processes. This lesson will cover the structure, classification, properties, and functions of amino acids. We will also explore their clinical relevance and practical applications, such as their role in metabolism, enzyme function, and protein synthesis. Connections will be made to related biomolecules like peptides, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. The lesson will address weak areas in general concepts to ensure a solid foundation in the topic. Key points include the 20 standard amino acids, their side chains, and how they contribute to the diversity of protein functions. The lesson will also cover the biochemical pathways involving amino acids and their significance in medical contexts, such as genetic disorders and metabolic diseases.",
