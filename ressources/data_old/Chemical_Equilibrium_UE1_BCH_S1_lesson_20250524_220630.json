        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Chemical equilibrium is the state in a reversible chemical reaction where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal. This means that the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant over time, even though the reactions are still occurring. This concept is fundamental in understanding how chemical reactions behave in biological systems."

          "text": "The reaction stops completely."
        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Le Chatelier's Principle states that if a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium moves to counteract the change. If the concentration of a reactant is increased, the equilibrium shifts to the right, favoring the formation of products to consume the excess reactant. This principle is crucial in understanding how biological systems respond to changes in concentration."

        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "a",
      "explanation": "Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) is a crucial concept in thermodynamics that determines the spontaneity of a reaction. At equilibrium, ΔG = 0, indicating that the reaction is at a state of minimum free energy. This concept is essential in understanding the energetics of chemical reactions in biological systems."
