    "lesson_content": "Detailed educational content covering Molecular Orbitals. Molecular orbitals are mathematical functions that describe the wave-like behavior of electrons in molecules. They are essential for understanding the electronic structure and bonding in molecules. This lesson will cover the formation of molecular orbitals from atomic orbitals, the concept of bonding and antibonding orbitals, and their significance in chemical reactions. We will also explore how molecular orbitals relate to the stability and reactivity of molecules. This content will address weak areas in general concepts by providing a solid foundation in the fundamental principles of molecular orbitals. Clinical relevance will be highlighted through examples of how molecular orbitals influence drug interactions and biochemical processes. Practical applications will include problem-solving exercises and case studies to reinforce understanding. Connections to General Chemistry will be made through discussions on the atom, covalent and non-covalent bonds, thermodynamics, and chemical equilibrium.",
