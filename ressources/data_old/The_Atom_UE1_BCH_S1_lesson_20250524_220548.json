    "lesson_content": "Detailed educational content covering The Atom. The lesson will include the fundamental structure of atoms, atomic theory, electron configurations, and the periodic table. It will also cover the clinical relevance of atomic properties in medical contexts, such as the role of atoms in biochemical reactions and drug interactions. Practical applications will be discussed, including how atomic principles are applied in diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy. Connections to General Chemistry will be made through discussions on covalent and non-covalent bonds, molecular orbitals, thermodynamics, and chemical equilibrium. This lesson will address weak areas in general concepts by providing clear, foundational explanations and examples. The content will be presented in a mixed learning style, incorporating visual aids, textual explanations, and interactive elements to cater to the student's learning preferences.",
