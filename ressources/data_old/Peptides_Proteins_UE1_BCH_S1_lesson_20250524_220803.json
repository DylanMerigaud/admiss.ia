    "lesson_content": "Detailed educational content covering Peptides and Proteins. Peptides and proteins are fundamental biomolecules essential for various biological functions. Peptides are short chains of amino acids, while proteins are larger and more complex, often performing structural, enzymatic, and regulatory roles. Understanding their structure, function, and diversity is crucial for medical students. This lesson will cover the basic concepts of peptides and proteins, their synthesis, structure, and clinical relevance. We will also explore how peptides and proteins interact with other biomolecules such as carbohydrates and lipids, and their role in enzymatic reactions. Address weak areas: ['general concepts'] by providing clear definitions, examples, and practical applications.",
