    "lesson_content": "**Cardiovascular System**\n\n**Definition:** The cardiovascular system is a network of organs and vessels responsible for circulating blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues, and removing waste products.\n\n**Key Notions:**\n• **Heart Anatomy:** The heart consists of four chambers (two atria and two ventricles) and is responsible for pumping blood.\n• **Blood Circulation:** Blood flows through the heart, lungs, and systemic circulation in a continuous loop, facilitated by arteries, veins, and capillaries.\n• **Vascular System:** Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, while veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart.\n\n**Clinical Relevance:** Understanding the cardiovascular system is crucial for diagnosing and treating conditions such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure.\n\n**Related Concepts:** Digestive System, Cardiovascular System, Respiratory System",
