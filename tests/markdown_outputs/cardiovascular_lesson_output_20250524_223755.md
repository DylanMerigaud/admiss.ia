## 📖 Lesson Content

**Cardiovascular System**

**Definition:** The cardiovascular system is a network of organs and vessels responsible for circulating blood throughout the body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues, and removing waste products.

**Key Notions:**
• **Heart Anatomy:** The heart consists of four chambers (two atria and two ventricles) and is responsible for pumping blood.
• **Blood Circulation:** Blood flows through the heart, lungs, and systemic circulation in a continuous loop, facilitated by arteries, veins, and capillaries.
• **Vascular System:** Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, while veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart.

**Clinical Relevance:** Understanding the cardiovascular system is crucial for diagnosing and treating conditions such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure.

**Related Concepts:** Digestive System, Cardiovascular System, Respiratory System
