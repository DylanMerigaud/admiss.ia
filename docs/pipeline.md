## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & Pipeline

  

### Core Concept

```

User Takes QCM ‚Üí Results Analysis ‚Üí Knowledge Graph Update ‚Üí AI Exercise Generation ‚Üí New Personalized QCM

```

  

### Pipeline Validation (Based on pipeline.md)

  

#### **Step 1: RAG Model ‚Üí Content Generation**

- **Input:** Medical knowledge database (ACC/DEV sources)

- **Output:**

- Dynamic lessons

- Personalized QCM exercises

- **Tech:** RAG model with medical domain fine-tuning

  

#### **Step 2: User Interaction**

- User reads generated lessons

- Performs QCM exercises

- **Tracking:** Lesson consumption, exercise completion, interaction patterns

  

#### **Step 3: Evaluation + Context Gathering**

```python

context_data = {

"success_rate": 0.75,

"errors": ["confuses_X_with_Y", "timing_issues"],

"time_taken": 120, # seconds per question

"free_text_responses": ["explanations", "reasoning"],

"confidence_levels": [3, 4, 2, 5], # per question

"learning_velocity": 0.8,

"error_patterns": ["medication_dosages", "symptom_confusion"]

}

```

  

#### **Step 4: AI Feedback & Adaptation**

- **LLM Analysis:** Process context to build more precise exercises

- **Adaptive Content:** Adjust to user's current level

- **Content Refinement:** Improve lesson quality based on performance

  

#### **Step 5: Skill Tree Update + "Affinage AI"**

```python

skill_tree_update = {

"unlocked_nodes": ["advanced_periodontics"],

"difficulty_adjustments": {"dental_anatomy": "increase"},

"improvement_areas": ["clinical_diagnosis"],

"mastery_levels": {"oral_hygiene": 0.9, "pharmacology": 0.6},

"prerequisite_gaps": ["basic_anatomy"]

}

```

  

#### **Step 6: Loop Back**

- Refined model delivers improved learning materials

- Continuous optimization cycle
